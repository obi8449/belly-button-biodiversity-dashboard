**Project Summary - BellyButton Biodiversity Dashboard**

The dashboard visualizes and analyzes the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the diverse microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset provides intriguing insights, revealing that a select few microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study, were present in over 70% of the sampled individuals, while the remaining species were relatively rare.

**Features**
* Data Retrieval and Initialization: The dashboard fetches the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from a provided URL and stores it for visualization and analysis.

* Sample Selector Dropdown: A user-friendly dropdown menu allows users to select specific individuals from the dataset. Upon selection, the dashboard generates interactive charts and metadata related to the chosen sample.

* Bar Charts: The application presents a horizontal bar chart that showcases the top 10 OTUs for the selected sample. Each bar represents an OTU, and its length corresponds to the sample value for that particular microbial species. The chart also provides labels with information about the OTUs.

* Bubble Chart: A captivating bubble chart displays the sample values per OTU ID. Each bubble represents an OTU, and its size is proportional to the sample value. The color scale of the bubbles is based on the OTU IDs, enhancing the visualization's richness.

* Metadata Panel: The dashboard includes a metadata panel that offers valuable demographic information about the selected individual. This feature allows users to correlate microbial data with specific characteristics of the subjects.

* Interactivity: As users select different individuals from the dropdown, the charts and metadata panel dynamically update, facilitating seamless exploration and analysis of the dataset.

**Usage**

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard provides an engaging platform to delve into the intriguing world of microbial colonization in human navels. Users can access the dashboard through the provided HTML file, which fetches and visualizes the dataset using D3.js and Plotly.js libraries. By interacting with the sample selector dropdown and exploring the charts and metadata panel, users can gain insights into the prevalence and distribution of microbial species in human navels.
